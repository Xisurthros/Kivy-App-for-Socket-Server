# Kivy-App-for-Socket-Server
Python Kivy app meant to connect to a Socket Server

You will have to create your own server for this.
I have a python socket server if you don't already have a server of your own.

This is just the code for the app, you will need to publish it with buildozer if you want it on your phone.
You can change the PNG for your own custom App image. You will need a 512x512 PNG.
